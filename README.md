# todo-app

A basic To Do app built using pure Vanilla JS and CSS3.

Add your todo list for the data and track it on the go. This app stores your todo list on your local storage and fetches it when you refresh or reopen the site, so you can keep track of the list throughout the day (As long as you don't clear the local storage or the browser cache).
